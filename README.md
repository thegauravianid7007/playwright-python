# Playwright + Python Automation Framework

This repository is my personal project to learn and practice **Playwright** with **Python**.  
The goal is to build a complete end-to-end (E2E) automation framework step by step, while documenting the journey.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

- Learn Python essentials for test automation.
- Understand Playwright fundamentals:
  - Browser & context handling
  - Locators & assertions
  - Page Object Model (POM)
  - Fixtures & configurations
- Implement utilities:
  - Logging
  - Screenshots on failure
  - Test data handling
- Add E2E test flows for sample applications.
- Setup reporting (pytest-html / Allure).
- Run tests in parallel.
- Integrate with GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- Maintain a clean, reusable framework structure.
